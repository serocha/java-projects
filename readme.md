# Welcome!

This repository serves as a place for me to collect small, one-off Java projects I've undertaken. The [standard deviation app](https://replit.com/@srocha/standard-deviation?v=1) in this repository is hosted on my Replit if you'd like to give it a try.

Feel free to also [check out my Python repo](https://github.com/serocha/python-projects) to see what I'm currently working on.
