# Welcome!

<p>This repository serves as a place for me to collect small, one-off Java projects I've undertaken. While I've got you here, feel free to also <a src="">check out my Python repo</a> to see what I'm currently working on.</p>
<br>
<p>I've hosted the standard deviation program in this repository on my Replit as well. It's got a simple CLI and some file I/O features. <a src="https://replit.com/@srocha/standard-deviation?v=1"> Click here to see it in action.</a></p>
